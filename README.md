# Bulls and Cows Game (C#)
This project implements the classic "Bulls and Cows" game as a console application in C#

## Game Rules
At the start, the player selects the **maximum number of guesses** (between 4 and 10).
The computer generates a random 4-letter sequence using the letters A–H, with no repeats.
On each turn, the player submits a guess (4 uppercase letters, no duplicates)
The system provides feedback:  
**V** → correct letter and position (bull)  
**X** → correct letter, wrong position (cow)
The player continues guessing until:
They guess correctly and win, or
They run out of guesses and lose.

## How to Run
1. Open the Visual Studio solution.  
2. Build the solution.  
3. Run the program.  
4. Follow the console prompts.
